Sources can be used in projects where it is needed.

## Build

A simple use case was added for demonstrating the usage of thread pool.
For building the demo, do the following steps:
1. `cmake .`
2. `make`

After executing the above commands, a binary file with thread_pool name must be created. Just run it by typing `./thread_pool`
